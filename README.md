# Jive
Jive is a web application that selects activities and restaurants, at random, to present our users with exciting plans at the press of a button. Tailored to require minimal input from the user, the Jive experience provides a plan for the whole day, or right that instant! We provide our users with a streamlined experience by minimizing the setup process required to start using the application. After the initial setup process the application stores user information to give great suggestions again and again. By utilizing pre-existing technology, Jive is a powerful tool to add spontaneity and fun back into the lives of our users.

## Getting Started
In order to provide a frictionless experience, Jive was created as a web application capable of running on many platforms.  At the landing page, registration or login will be required. User preferences can be accessed via the gear icon to the bottom left. These changes will be used and reflected on the server. Follow the onscreen prompts for plan now to generate a single event and restaurant suggestion, or use the plan tomorrow button to generate suggestions to fill the entire day.
